# My k8s dashboard

This is a WIP project.

I am building a tool to explore resource usage, requests, limits and quotas by namespace/pod/container in a treeview table.

I am running all my personal projects a single large Kubernetes cluster and it is getting difficult to understand resource usage/limits by project.

Other dashboards are not so good at displaying these stats, so I decided to build my own :D
